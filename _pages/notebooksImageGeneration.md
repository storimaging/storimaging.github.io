      excerpt: "*Texture synthesis* attempts to, given an input texture image, produce an output texture image that is both visually similar and pixel-wise different from the input texture. The output image should ideally be perceived as another part of the same large piece of homogeneous material from which the input texture originated. This practical session explains how to implement the Texture Synthesis through optimization based on the algorithm described on [L. Gatys, A. S. Ecker, and M. Bethge. Texture synthesis using convolutional neural networks. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 262–270, 2015. 4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07376).
