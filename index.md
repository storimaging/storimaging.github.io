intro:
    - excerpt: 'This website gathers several Python notebooks in imaging science. It covers classic and historical models as well as very recent research topics, including those based on developments in artificial intelligence (machine learning and deep neural networks). The main authors of these practical sessions are [Julie Delon](https://judelo.github.io), [Bruno Galerne](https://www.idpoisson.fr/galerne/), [Agnès Desolneux](https://desolneux.perso.math.cnrs.fr), [Valentin De Bortoli](https://vdeborto.github.io) and [Lucía Bouza](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/lucia-bouza-heguerte/). Some of the notebooks are still being developed or improved, feel free to contact us to report errors or mistakes!'
