    - excerpt: 'This site and its practical sessions are part of the accompanying material of the book "Stochastic Recipes in Image Processing". This book, written by Agn√®s Desolneux, Julie Delon, Bruno Galerne and Valentin De Bortoli, presents in an educational way an overview of stochastic models and approaches used in image processing and analysis. It covers classic and historical models as well as very recent research topics, especially those based on developments in artificial intelligence (machine learning and deep neural networks).'
